# PhD Open Days Workshop "Practical Introduction to Machine Learning"
This repository contains the code and presentation used in the Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico PhD Open Days Workshop "Practical Introduction to Machine Learning" which took place October 28th 2020.

The Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Titanic folders each contain a Jupyter Notebook with the code examples shown during the workshop. In order to run them, you should install the latest version of [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then install the libraries in the requirements file (by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`). 

If you don't have the Jupyter Notebook library installed yet, then you should also [install it](https://jupyter.org/install).  Once installed, you can run `jupyter notebook` directly on your command line and from there you should be able to select and run the notebooks. For more instructions on how to run Jupyter Notebooks, please check the [official documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).

If you have any questions or problems while using the code, feel free to contact me.
